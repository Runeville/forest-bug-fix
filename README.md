# Forest App Bug Fix
There's a bug in my favorite smartphones app Forest. As you see on screenshot below I have focused for 3 hours 35 mins today doing Physics, Programming, Reading and Music.
Now if you sum all percents of the circle you will see it's 101% (47% + 21% + 19% + 14% = 101%) that is impossible in real world.

# Solution
So I came up with a solution. The program is made with Python but I commented almost every line. The program checks if sum of all rounded percentages is higher or lower that 100% and increase or decrease value of the highest or lowest after dot value by 1 if so.
I hope that Forest developers will fix this bug.

## Output
Result with bug: 101%

Percentage with bug: ['47%', '21%', '19%', '14%']

Real result: 100%

Real percentage: ['46%', '21%', '19%', '14%']
